<h3>Description</h3><br> <p>The script automates the process of currency conversion on the XE.com website.</p>
<p>The script reads the “currency.json” file and its contents are parsed from JSON format into a JavaScript object named “currencies”. The script iterates over each currency in the “currencies” object. For each currency, it navigates to the XE currency converter page with the specified conversion parameters (“From” and “To” currencies). Next, the script takes screenshots of the conversion results and saves them with filenames indicating the currency pairs.</p>
